AANCHAL PANDEY

I work with data to understand problems, design solutions, and support better decisions.

My background spans analytics, machine learning, and business problem-solving. I focus on building practical, data-driven systems—from exploratory analysis and modeling to lightweight deployment—while keeping business context at the center of technical work.

I am interested in learning systems, data products, and intelligent applications that scale beyond experiments and deliver real-world impact. I value clarity in thinking, correctness in execution, and continuous improvement in both skills and outcomes.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in data science, applied machine learning, and modern analytics workflows, while exploring emerging approaches in NLP and AI-powered systems.
